						In my dreams you're dying
It picks me up, I can't stop crying
I just wanna live forever
Keep my promises, keep it together
In my dreams you're living
Open your eyes, and I wake up forgiven
Just a little something within the blood
How can I live with so much love?
Singing

Be my Wendy, I'll be your Peter Pan
Come on baby, take my hand
We can walk if we don't feel like flying
We can live, I don't feel like dying
Be my Wendy, I'll be your Peter Pan
Come on baby, you've got no plans
Was it good? Got all the answers
Man, women keep blowing their cancer singing

In my dreams we're kissing
It wakes me up but you've gone missin'
Once so close, but we've grown apart
And all the sickness, starts in the heart
In my dreams you're dying
It wakes me up, and I can't stop crying
'Cause it's the day I'm not dead, an American dream, honey
And it leaves you baby if you let it leave singing

Be my Wendy, I'll be your Peter Pan
Come on baby, take my hand
We can walk if we don't feel like flying
We can live, I don't feel like dying
Be my Wendy, I'll be your Peter Pan
Come on baby, you've got no plans
A little something within the blood
I can not live, with so much love singing
