						I got the money, and I got the time
I got a secret, gonna make you mine
I can feel you making eyes at me
Baby you can try, but you can't deny

Chemistry (chemistry)
Chemistry (chemistry)
Chemistry (chemistry)
Chemistry (chemistry)

Put your eyes on another glass
Ask for another you can take your chance
Ask for a dance with another boy
My heart's a city, you're out to destroy

Chemistry (destroy me)
Chemistry (chemistry)
Chemistry (baby, destroy me)
Chemistry

Dance with your boyfriend all night long
Tell him you really really love his song
Close your eyes, its me you're gonna see
Ain't no way to fake it

Chemistry (chemistry)
Chemistry (chemistry)
You and me, we've got (chemistry)
Chemistry
You and me, we've got (chemistry)
Baby you and me
Could this be that (chemistry)
Chemistry, baby you and me

Go to the city, go to the store
Ask for a loan from another bank
Call your mother, make an excuse
I'm gonna have you baby it's no use

(Chemistry) I know you
(Chemistry) girl I know you
(Chemistry) feel like I know you
Chemistry

Well you've got one choice, maybe two
You can leave with me or I'll go with you
I know you haven't even met me yet
But you're gonna love me baby when you get to know me

(Chemistry) you know me
(Chemistry) girl you know me
(Chemistry) feel like you know me

Right, you and me, we've got (chemistry)
Baby you and me
Could this be that (chemistry)
Chemistry, baby you and me
You and me, we've got (chemistry)

Baby you and me
Could you start to see that (chemistry)
Chemistry, baby you and me
You and me we got chemistry
Baby you and me
Could you start to see that
Chemistry, baby you and me

Gonna say it again
I said you and me, we've got (chemistry)
Baby you and me (you and me)
Could this be that (chemistry)
Chemistry, baby you and me (you and me)
You and me, we've got (chemistry)
Chemistry, baby you and me (you and me)
Could you start to see that (chemistry)
Chemistry, baby you and me (you and me)
You and me, we've got (chemistry)
Chemistry, baby you and me (you and me)
Could this be that (chemistry)
Chemistry, baby you and me (you and me)
You and me, we've got (chemistry)
Chemistry, baby you and me (you and me)
Could you start to see that (chemistry)
Chemistry, baby you and me (you and me)
